## Singly Linked List
A linked list is a common data structure that is made of a chain of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the chain.

### Challenge
one of the challenges was how to know if the inserted node is inserted successfully by know the length of the linked list . <br>
I made a counter as a property in linked list class and each time we go throuth the Insert functuion and insert to make it plus one , eventually its going to be the linked list length.<br>

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Used Classes to implement the linked list with the O(1) and O(n) for it's methods .

### API

**insert**<br>
Arguments: value<br>
Returns: nothing<br>
This method Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.<br>
And if the head doesnt equal null it will add that value to the next node.<br>

**includes**<br>
Arguments: value<br>
Returns: Boolean<br>
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.<br>
This method will return true if the value found in the linked list and false if not .<br>

<hr>

**to string**
Arguments: none <br>
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:<br>
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"<br>
