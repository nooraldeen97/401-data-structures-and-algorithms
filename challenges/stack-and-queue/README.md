# Stack and Queue<br>
## Stack<br>
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does <br>not reference its previous.<br>


# Challenge
Create a Stack, and a Queue that have the top properties.<br>



# Approach & Efficiency<br>

All the methods in the Stack and Queue classes are of a big O(1) time complexity<br>

# API

Common terminology for a stack is:<br>

1- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.<br>

2- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an<br> exception will be raised.<br>

3- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty<br> stack an exception will be raised.<br>

4- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.<br>

## Queue<br>
Common terminology for a queue is:<br>
1- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.<br>

2- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception<br> will be raised.<br>

4- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is<br> empty an exception will be raised.<br>

5- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.<br>
