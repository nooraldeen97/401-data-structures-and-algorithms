# Trees
A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes.

- The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children

# Challenge
* Node : Node class has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

* Binary Tree class : BinaryTree class Define a method for each of the depth first traversals.

* Binary Search Tree : BinarySearchTree class is a sub-class of the Binary Tree Class.

* Code raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods.

# API
* Binary Tree class method :

* preOrder() : prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first in order root >> left >> right.

* inOrder(): prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first in order left >> root >> right.

* postOrder(): prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first in order left >> right >> root , returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

* Binary Search Tree method (BST) :

* Add() : Takes a value and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

* Contains() : Takes a value and Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.<br>

# Approach & Efficiency
Add():<br>
Time : O(n).<br>

Space : O(n).<br>

Contains():<br>
Time : O(n).<br>

Space : O(n).<br>
